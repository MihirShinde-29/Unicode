# Productivity Tracker
This is a simple looking app containing two pages __Routine Manager__ & __Expense Manager__.

The __Routine Manager__ handles all your tasks & keep the check on the time spent by you to complete those tasks.

The __Expense Manager__ stores your income & savings & takes all your expenses. Once the expense is paid, it deducts the amount from your income first then your savings.
